            <h3>Recipe</h3>
            <ol class="task-list">
                <li>Boil the potatoes (peeled or washed with the skin) in a pot with cold water and salt. Once cooked, remove from the pot, run through cold water, let it cool (peel if they were cooked with the skin on) and make a smooth puree.</li>
                <li>Season with salt and pepper, season with nutmeg and add the flour in a sprinkle, the beaten egg (if it is small, use 2) and form a homogeneous dough. Cool for 10 minutes in the refrigerator.</li>
                <li>Take small portions of dough and make long, thin rolls to shape the gnocchi.</li>
                <li>Arrange on a clean, floured surface. Cut gnocchi approximately 2.5 cm long, leaving them on the floured table so that they do not stick. Then, pass them through the tines of a fork or a fork, applying slight pressure with your thumb to shape them. </li>
                <li>Boil water in a large pot with a handful of coarse salt. Carefully add the gnocchi and as they rise to the surface they will be ready to remove with the slotted spoon.</li>
                <li> Serve directly on each plate and add the chosen sauce.</li>
